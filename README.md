Hi,

Thanks for coming here and sharing sometime with us, after the interview we usually have a fun small project called Hyper Recipes that I hope you will enjoy.

The goal is to make an iOS app to add, edit, remove and see recipes, you decide how it looks, but we appreciate good looking apps and thoughtful user experiences.

Also we enjoy making some pop corn and reading your code like a fantasy book of dragons and unicorns.

We have a nice backend that will take care of your delicious recipes. You can get the documentation of the backend here:

Your project should make use of AFNetworking and CoreData. Asynchronous operations are really important, don't lock the UI and the less loading indicators, the better (:

When you are done, please link us to your project in Github.

Thanks and I hope you enjoy making some recipes.

Best,
